Hi!

Feel free to contribute new links and resources to this document.<br />
Please add your resource under the appropriate heading,<br />
creating new ones where necessary.

It'd also be great if you added a few words describing your resource!<br />
For example: if it's a paid resource, what format it's in, if it's<br /> 
particularly good for beginner or advanced people, etc.
